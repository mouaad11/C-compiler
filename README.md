# C_compiler
This project is an algorithms compiler that analyses french written pseudo-code lexically, sytaxically and semantically.
to run this file, it it preferrable to compile the "compilateur.c" using "dev c++" program, as it was the environement i was working on.
the program uses all the text files included to read and write data.
the "Rapport.pdf" file is a report i made on the project, it includes some screenshots and the source code.
